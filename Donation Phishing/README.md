## What is Donation Phishing

Donation Phishing is a Python application using Flask that allows users to submit personal information through a secure web form. The application saves the submitted data in text files and uses Serveo to make the local server accessible via a public URL. The app also handles port conflicts to ensure smooth operation.

## Features

- **Form Submission**: Users can submit personal information through a web form.
- **Data Storage**: Information is saved as text files in a `People` directory.
- **Serveo Tunneling**: Exposes the Flask application to the internet using Serveo.
- **Port Conflict Handling**: Automatically resolves port conflicts on port 5000.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Flask library (install via pip):
     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```
   - SSH access to Serveo (no account needed, but ensure SSH is available).

2. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone the repository or download the application script to your local machine.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
   - Execute the script with:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**:
   - Run the Python script. The application will:
     - Create a `People` directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
     - Kill any processes using port 5000 to avoid conflicts.
     - Set up a Serveo tunnel to expose the local Flask server.

2. **Access the Web Form**:
   - Once the server is running, access the web form through the public URL provided by Serveo. The URL will be displayed in your terminal after running the script.

3. **Submit Information**:
   - Fill out the form with the required personal information:
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Email
     - Phone Number
     - Birthday (format: DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Optional fields include Social Media Accounts, Height, Weight, Eye Color, Hair Color, and Country.
   - Submit the form.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - The submitted data is saved in text files within the `People` directory, named using the format `FirstName_LastName.txt`.

## Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection**: The application saves data in text files securely.
- **Privacy**: Submitted information is used only for processing and stored securely.
